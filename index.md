# ePortfolio

Here, you can find all my enhancements as well as my [GitHub page](https://github.com/pht-even).

## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my educational journey at Southern New Hampshire University and while developing this ePortfolio, I have learned a lot about computer technologies and languages as well as the industry itself. Courses like IT-145 taught the basics of programming and the standards programmers are expected to follow. Courses like CS-260 taught me the multitude of algorithms and data structures that are used in the industry. These include hash tables, binary search trees, and sorting algorithms. The DAD courses taught me about databases and the importance of managing them as well. All of these programs and the this ePortfolio demonstrate my competency in computer science. 

The artifacts I will be enhancing are from various courses throughout my time at SNHU. I will be performing enhancements on these artifacts to improved on their efficiency as well as their functionality. The Zoo Authenticator program I will be enhancing in the first section was written in Java. I will translate this program to Python as well as add hash table functionality. The final enhancement will be performed on a small excerpt of SQL code. I will not be using the SQL code as I plan on creating a RESTful PAI using MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.

## Enhancement One - Software Design and Eng.
### Narrative 

My first enhancement involves the ZooAuthenticator program. This was made in IT-145 using Java. Originally, it used looping through an outside file to check for hashing values. I decided tio translate this program to Python. I mostly used Java during my time programming, so translating the project into Python was a fun challenge that I took on. It also demonstrates the use of dictionaries as hash tables.

This is a console-only program. Users can choose to either log in as a current employee or register as a new one. If the user chooses to log in, they are prompted to enter their username and password. If both the username and password come back as a match, a file is opened that corresponds with that employees job. I will further explore registering as a new employee in the Enhancement Two section.

The reason this artifact was included was because it demonstrates my comprehension on not only Java but Python programming as well. It also demonstrates consistency, programming best practices, software design element, and software engineering elements.

During the enhancement of the ZooAuthenticator, I learned a lot about Python and its data structures. I've also been able to see the amount of progress I have made since the creation of the original program.

## Enhancement Two - Data Structures and Algorithms
### Narrative 

This is an extension onto Enhancement One. However, more functionality has been added to the program. My goal was to translate the original program from Java to Python and implement a hash table to manage employees. I have accomplished the first goal, the translation. I expanded on the dictionary use. I have added the ability to update, find and remove employees from the Python dictionary and save the results in the employees.json file. Any person can register as a new employee via a registration process. When an admin logs in however, they are able to view employees, remove employees, and update employee information with search algorithms. This is accomplished by using key-value pairs which significantly cut down on search and load times within the program. This artifact shows competency of data structures through the use of dictionaries and algorithms through the search, update, and delete functions that accompany the dictionary.

The thing I learned most during this process is about Python dictionaries. In Java, I remember having to construct the hash table from scratch. Although this might have been just an exploration/learning exercise of a hash table, I found implementing a Python dictionary much easier.

## Enhancement Three - Databases
### Narrative 

This artifact is a RESTful API that utilizes MongoDB, Express, and Node.js to perform CRUD operations on a database. This artifact was created recently but was inspired by the DAD-220 course along with the CS-340 course. Originally, this project was a collection of simple SQL CRUD commands. The enhancements I have performed on this artifact have made it into a RESTful API. 

Justification for this artifact is straight-forward. This encompasses the concept of databases. This artifact demonstrates my knowledge on database structure, CRUD commands, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. I met my enhancement objectives, but I would have really liked to turn the project into a web page using forms. I was unable to complete this at this time, however.
  
I came into this enhancement with very low confidence. I wasnâ€™t able to previously get a fully working RESTful API working in my CS-4340 course, but I managed it this go-around.  RESTful API can be very complicated as I have learned during this enhancement. They can also be very confusing if they grow large. I also learned about Node.js during this enhancement which is key because I used PyMongo previously. Overall, this was a challenging experience getting everything to work as intended and I am happy with the outcome.
