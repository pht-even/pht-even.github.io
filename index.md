## Code Review


## Enhancement One - Software Design and Eng.
### Narrative 

My first enhancement involves the ZooAuthenticator program. This was made in IT-145 using Java. Originally, it used looping through an outside file to check for hashing values. I decided tio translate this program to Python. I mostly used Java during my time programming, so translating the project into Python was a fun challenge that I took on. It also demonstrates the use of dictionaries as hash tables.

This is a console-only program. Users can choose to either log in as a current employee or register as a new one. If the user chooses to log in, they are prompted to enter their username and password. If both the username and password come back as a match, a file is opened that correpsonds with that employees job. I will further explore registering as a new employee in the Enhancement Two section.

The reason this artifact was included was because it demonstrates my comprehension on not only Java but Python programming as well. It also demonstrates consistency, programming best practices, software design element, and software engineering elements.

During the enhancement of the ZooAuthenticator, I learned a lot about Python and its data structures. I've also been able to see the amount of progress I have made since the creation of the original program.
